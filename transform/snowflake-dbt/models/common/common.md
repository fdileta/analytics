{% docs fct_usage_ci_minutes %}

This table replicates the Gitlab UI logic that generates the CI minutes Usage Quota for both personal namespaces and top level group namespaces. The codebase logic used to build this model can be seen mapped in [this diagram](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/0b8b66e6-8536-4a5d-b992-9e324581187d/0_0).

Namespaces from the `namespace_snapshots_monthly_all` CTE that are not present in the `namespace_statistics_monthly_all` CTE are joined into the logic with NULL `shared_runners_seconds` since these namespaces have not used CI Minutes on GitLab-provided shared runners. Since these CI Minutes are neither trackable nor monetizable, they can be functionally thought of as 0 `shared_runners_minutes_used_overall`. The SQL code has been implemented with this logic as justification.

It also adds two additional columns which aren't calculated in the UI, which are `limit_based_plan` and `status_based_plan` which are independent of whether there aren't projects with `shared_runners_enabled` inside the namespaces and only take into account how many minutes have been used from the monthly quota based in the plan of the namespace.

Information on the Enterprise Dimensional Model can be found in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/edw/)

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_namespace_member_summary %}

This model summarizes namespace user counts by accounting for all of the ways that a user be granted (direct or inherited) access to a namespace, AKA "membership". Bots and users awaiting access to a namespace are also accounted for. These counts are reported at the `ultimate_parent_namespace_id` grain.

Importantly, this model calculates the field [`billable_member_count`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#billable-users) - i.e. the number of members should be counted toward the seat count for a subscription (note: this also applies to namespaces without a subscription for the convenience of determining seats in use). 

There are 5 general ways that a user can have access to a group A:
* Be a **group member** of group A.
* Be a **group member** of B, where B is a descendant (subgroup) of group A.
* Be a **project member** of b, where b is owned by A or one of A's descendants.
* Be a group member of N or a parent group of N, where N is invited to a project underneath A via [project group links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#sharing-a-project-with-a-group).
* Be a group member of Y or a parent group of Y, where Y is invited to A or one of A's descendants via [group group links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#sharing-a-group-with-another-group).

An example of these relationships is shown in this diagram:
